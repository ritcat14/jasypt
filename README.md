JASYPT: Java Simplified Encryption
----------------------------------

Jasypt (Java Simplified Encryption) is a java library which allows the
developer to add basic encryption capabilities to his/her projects with
minimum effort, and without the need of having deep knowledge on how
cryptography works.

This project is a Fork of the official Jasypt. It included BouncyCastle 1.81-beta build for fixes related to IV, and Hibernate 6 support.

For the BC fix, you will need to include the ``jasypt-2.0.0.jar`` in your dependencies

For Hibernate 6 support, you will need to include ``jasypt-hibernate6-2.0.0.jar`` in your dependencies.
